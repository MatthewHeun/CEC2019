This paper presents a survey of Christian perspectives, from ancient to modern, on a
variety of sustainability-related topics such as stewardship of the natural world,
economic growth and technological change, energy, and human population. The emphasis is on
the development of thought and the lineage of ideas, with application to modern viewpoints
on current issues such as climate change, sustainable development, and human migration. We
use Willis Jenkins’ topology (Ecologies of Grace) to organize three modern strands
(ecojustice, stewardship, and “ecological spiritualities”) arising from three Christian
traditions (Roman Catholicism, reformed Christianity, and Eastern Orthodoxy,
respectively).

The paper will cover a broad range of Christian thought and teaching in a digestible and
coherent format. It will serve as a supplement to a future engineering textbook on
sustainability challenges. Textbook chapters will provide a platform of background
knowledge to facilitate one-hour in-class discussions of several sustainability topics or
challenges. The conference presentation will highlight one area of Christian thought
(stewardship) and focus on piloting classroom discussion questions related to the theology
of sustainability.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Sustainability is a popular topic and is of increasing concern in the modern world. This
paper will begin to answer the questions ``how have Christians in the past thought about
sustainability topics?'' ```How do Christians today think about sustainability topics?''
and ``Where do these views come from?'' We will end with some questions for thought and
discussion.

Sustainability is often organized into three categories: environmental, economic, and
social. Environmental sustainability involves the idea of preserving the natural world.
Christians have historically understood this as stewardship of the natural world, going
back to the charge God gives humankind in Genesis 1:26. Economic sustainability refers to
the preservation and increase in value of human activities. In other words, not everything
we do can lose money. Social sustainability refers to relationships among humans -- that
there should be justice, peace, order, and flourishing in human society. For Christians,
the root of this concern is the command to ``love your neighbor as yourself.'' Overarching
these three areas are concerns for human shalom and wellbeing.

How Christians have understood these imperatives has varied considerably over millennia. 
We talked about survey versus introduction and how to handle references.

\section{Environmental}
\label{sec:environmental}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Natural world is inherently good.
Natural world should be conquered and ruled over (in part, because it is `red in tooth and claw.')
