\section{Sustainability and the disciplines}
\label{sec:sustainability_and_the_disciplines}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Because of circumstances in our world today, 
concerns about environmental, economic, and social 
issues are significant. 
The concept of ``sustainability'' encompasses all three areas
with a view toward the future. 
(See Figure~\ref{fig:3_sustain}.)
One definition of sustainability is
``Sustainability emerges from choices that, on balance, 
promote economic vitality, social equity, and a flourishing natural environment 
both now and for generations to come''~\autocite{Calvin-College-2017}.

Sustainability is considered to be a ``grand challenge,'' 
and becoming more sustainable requires solving 
complex, multidisciplinary, and multifaceted problems
with both technical and non-technical, even philosophical, aspects. 
We engineers design and operate the machines and systems that
generate economic growth by providing employment and economic output, 
enhance society bring people together through communication technologies, and
enhance the natural environment.
But we also design machines and systems that
replace human workers, 
foster online hate, 
and  
consume non-renewable materials
emit pollution, contributing to environmental degradation.
Thus, we have an important role to play in the transition to a sustainable future. 

But what guides engineers to make choices that lead to sustainability?
