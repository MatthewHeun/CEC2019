@inbook{Yuengert:2014,
	Abstract = {The popes do not call for ``Roman Catholic Economics,'' if by this it is meant a fully integrated treatment of Roman Catholic theology and economics. On the contrary, they repeatedly express respect for an autonomous economic science, whose insights they need for a fuller understanding of person and society. They do not want to build a new economic science on Catholic principles; instead they wish to engage the existing field of economics in a conversation about society. For economics to serve Catholic social teaching there must be a place in its models for personal agency, for the social nature of the person, and for sin. Economics has analytical resources at hand to begin this engagement. Modern economics has much to offer the current CST project: its understanding of the unintended order that exists in markets, and a practical sense of what is possible in a world of scarcity.},

@book{Armstrong:1988,
	Abstract = {This essay collection brings together the complete works of two of Catholicism's greatest proponents of virtuous poverty. Francis of Assisi, from whom the present pope took his name, brought renewal to the medieval church by stressing the wisdom of poverty over that of wealth. His friend Clare, who founded the women's order of Franciscans (subsequently called the Poor Clares), fiercely defended that vision. She insisted that her sisters should govern themselves and reminded them: ``The Lord often reveals what is best to the lesser [among us].''},
